Technology Stack :

1. HTML
HTML is used to define the layout of the website, including the placement of text, images, links, forms, and other multimedia elements. Each product page, category page, and other sections of the website are structured using HTML.

2. CSS
CSS styles the HTML elements, defining their appearance. This includes setting the colors, fonts, spacing, and overall look of the website. CSS ensures that the website is visually appealing and consistent across different devices. The site uses:
Custom CSS: For unique styles tailored specifically to the branding and design of StyleSwift.
Bootstrap CSS: A framework that provides pre-designed components and responsive grid layouts, enhancing the speed of development and ensuring a mobile-friendly design.

3. Javascript
Allowing users to add, remove, and update items in their cart.
 - Product Image Zoom: Providing a detailed view of products.
 - Form Validation: Ensuring user inputs are correct before submission.
 - Dynamic Content Updates: Such as updating the cart total in real-time.
 - Bootstrap JavaScript Components: Leveraging Bootstrap’s JavaScript components like modals, 
   carousels, and dropdowns to enhance interactivity and user experience.

4. Bootstrap 
Bootstrap is utilized for its comprehensive library of CSS and JavaScript components, which help in creating a cohesive and responsive design. The framework provides:
 - Responsive Grid System: To create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
 - Pre-styled Components: Such as buttons, navigation bars, forms, and alerts, ensuring a 
   consistent and professional look.
 - JavaScript Plugins: For interactive elements like modals, tooltips, and carousels without 
   needing to write custom code from scratch.

Integration and Overall Architecture
 - Static Website: Since StyleSwift does not have a backend, it functions as a static website. 
   All the data and content are served directly from static files without server-side 
   processing.
 - Client-Side Operations: All operations, including shopping cart management and interactive 
   features, are handled on the client side using JavaScript.

By leveraging these technologies, StyleSwift achieves a high-quality, responsive, and interactive e-commerce platform that offers a seamless user experience despite the absence of a backend server.
